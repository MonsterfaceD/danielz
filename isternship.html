    <h1>ISTernship 2024</h1>
    <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/IMG_2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
        It was the time between my completed master's degree and the start of my phd studies. I got accepted for the ISTernship program, which is an scientific internship at the Institute for Science and Technology Austria. Spending the summer on campus, which is near Vienna, gifted me amazing experiences. Hiking, biking, swimming, classical touristing with friends, my ex-girlfriend and family: all of that in a beautiful city with a beautiful forest next to the city I lived in (Klosterneuburg). I am thankful for everyone I met there and had an amazing time.
