        Summer 2024: the time between my completed master's degree and the start of my phd studies. I got accepted for the ISTernship program, which is an scientific internship at the Institute for Science and Technology Austria. Spending the summer on campus, which is near Vienna, gifted me amazing experiences. Hiking, biking, swimming, classical touristing with friends, as well as my ex-girlfriend and my family who visited me once: all of that in the beautiful Vienna. And I loved running in the beautiful forest next to the smaller city I lived in (Klosterneuburg). I am thankful for everyone I met on this trip and could spend an amazing time with. 10.03.25
